= Plan for Practice #2
:toc:

== Homework
* [ ] Explain the task

== Different OOP Implementations
* [ ] "private" in Python
* [ ] "interfaces" in C++
* [ ] "Diamond" inheritance in C++

== Interface Types
* [ ] Marker
* [ ] Functional
* [ ] Trait, mixin

== Break Barbara Liskov Principle
LSP is about contracts and not about code.

* [ ] Preconditions cannot be strengthened in the subtype
* [ ] Postconditions cannot be weakened in the subtype
* [ ] Invariants must be preserved in the subtype

== Break Inheritance
* [ ] InstrumentedSet
* [ ] ForwardedSet

== Open Closed Principle with Duck Simulator

=== Inheritance

* [ ] Add new behavior -  `fly()`
* [ ] Add a new type - `DecoyDuck`

==== Composition vs Aggregation
An explanation from Stackoverflow https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/61527/314568

* `A` "owns" `B` => Composition: `B` has no meaning or purpose in the system without `A`
* `A` "uses" `B` => Aggregation: `B` exists independently (conceptually) from `A`fa

.Example 1:
....
A Company is an aggregation of People. A Company is a composition of Accounts. When a Company ceases to do business its Accounts cease to exist but its People continue to exist.
....

.Example 2: (very simplified)
....
A Text Editor owns a Buffer (composition). A Text Editor uses a File (aggregation). When the Text Editor is closed, the Buffer is destroyed but the File itself is not destroyed.
....
